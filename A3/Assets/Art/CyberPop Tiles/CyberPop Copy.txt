Get ready to jack in to the CyberPop Interior Tiles Add-on! This tileset pack includes multiple interior locations for your characters to explore, lovingly created in my POP! graphic style.

This asset pack includes:

    Interior ground and wall tiles - plus Auto-tile compatible versions
    Six sheets of various objects including signs, shop inventory, kitchens, beds, staircases, computer terminals, dirt, detritus and more!
    Enough assets to cover multiple interior locations with options to expand using the fully compatible range of Horror City and Slasher forest asset packs!

Arranged in both 16x16 and 'plug and play' 32x32 RPG Maker VX Ace versions for ease of use.

Now includes 48x48 RPG Maker MV versions at no extra cost!

As is the case with all of my asset packs available on itch, this pack is Royalty Free and usable in any engine without limitation - all I ask is that if you have  credits, to please pop my handle [VexedEnigma/PixelJustice] or name [D Machin] in there!
